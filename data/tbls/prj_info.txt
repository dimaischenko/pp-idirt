IDIRT	specificity in IP of different kinds	Codon optimized (LD401, LD288) or WT (MT302) L1 was expressed with different isotopic labeling (tagged was heavy, untagged was light and the cell powders were mixed before purification); ORF1-FLAG (LD288) of ORF2p-3xFLAG (LD401, MT302) was purified and washed; then the material was eluted and analyzed.	1a	heavy LD288, light LD259, 1 hour	The degree to which proteins specifically co-purify with codon optimized ORF1-FLAG (determined by %H). NOTE: these are "equilibrium" experiments, but are conducted with distinctive end points.. there is some kinetic data in here by looking at the difference in the H/L ratios in the 2 time points.

NOTE: these are "equilibrium" experiments, but are conducted with distinctive end points.. there is some kinetic data in here by looking at the difference in the H/L ratios in the 2 time points. Probably not as much difference as observed for the LD288 experiments (1a, 2a).

RNAse	sensitivity to RNase A/T1 treatment for maintenance of interaction with ORF2p	Codon optimized L1 was expressed in heavy and light isotopic labeling; ORF2p-3xFLAG was purified; on the beads it was treated with RNase A/T1 OR BSA; after treatment the supernatant was removed and beads washed; then the material was eluted and different purified isotope labeled materials were mixed. 	3b	LD401: light RNAse-treated, heavy BSA-treated, MS run2	The degree to which a protein is released from an interaction with ORF2-3xFLAG after treatment with RNases. The %H is used to determine which proteins are MORE present in the BSA treated - the proteins that are less present are considered RNase sensitive.
